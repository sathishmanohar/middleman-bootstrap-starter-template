This is just a starter template I made myself with bootstrap saas files included via npm

To use this starter template. 

- Create a folder as `mkdir project_name`
- Go to the folder `cd project_name`
- Initialize git repo `git init`
- Git pull from this repository URL `git@github.com:sathishmanohar/middleman-bootstrap-starter-template.git`
- Make sure the ruby version is installed or change version in `.ruby-version`
- Run bundle install
- You should be able to start middleman server now
- Drop the README commit if you want to before building upon the template
